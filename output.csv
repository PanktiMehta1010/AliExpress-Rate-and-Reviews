"Good speaker, Bad software","This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc. Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo. For example when you say- 1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer. 2) continue with next query like how to reach there ? Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do.. This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there. Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you. Amazon music has very limited music base. So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.","20 Oct 2018","","","Yes","Amit","3.0","Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/product-reviews/B07PFFMP9P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Very poor sound recognition.","It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7. But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff). Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad.","19 Oct 2018","","","Yes","Parag","1.0","Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/product-reviews/B07PFFMP9P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"My first Smart Speaker","This was launched on 11th and I got the product by 12th. Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations : 1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time. 2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass. 3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder. 4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff. 6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English","15 Oct 2018","","","Yes","Chinmaya D.","5.0","Echo Dot (3rd Gen) – New and improved smart speaker with Alexa (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/product-reviews/B07PFFMP9P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
